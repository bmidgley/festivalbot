Utah Arts Festival 2019 Draw Bot

Built using:

* two microbit boards; one controller you hold and tilt and the other in the car
* elecfreaks.com servo driver board (probably also runs ring:bit car)
* Feetech FT-MC-003 4WD Mini Mobile Robotics Platform Kit (bed only)
* Feetech FS90R 360 Degree Continuous Rotation Micro Servo Motor + RC Tire Wheel (two)

Drill a hole in the center back of the sled to hold a sharpie.

I had to use an older IDE by going to [https://makecode.microbit.org/v1#editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/v1#editor) to build the js. There is a bug in the current editor that prevents the use of servos.

Press and hold button A while driving to slow down to turtle mode. Hold button B while driving for rabbit mode.
